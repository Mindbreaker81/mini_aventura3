# Fixes Applied to Bosc de Lectura Game

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ❌ i18next Configuration Warning
**Error:** `react-i18next:: useTranslation: You will need to pass in an i18next instance by using initReactI18next`

**Root Cause:** The project was using `next-i18next` which is designed for the Pages Router, but this project uses the App Router (Next.js 13+).

**Solution:**
- Removed `next-i18next` dependency
- Created a new `I18nProvider` component using `i18next` and `react-i18next` directly
- Added the provider to the root layout to wrap the entire application
- Updated all imports from `next-i18next` to the new provider

**Files Modified:**
- Created: `src/app/components/I18nProvider.tsx`
- Modified: `src/app/layout.tsx`
- Modified: `src/app/world/bosc-lectura/page.tsx`
- Modified: `src/app/world/bosc-lectura/ReadingGame.tsx`
- Modified: `src/app/world/mision-mapamundi-v2/page.tsx`
- Removed: `next-i18next.config.js`

### 2. ⚠️ Blockly Deprecation Warning
**Warning:** `Blockly.Workspace.getAllVariables was deprecated in v12 and will be deleted in v13`

**Root Cause:** The Blockly library (v12.1.0) contains deprecated methods that show warnings when called internally during code generation.

**Solution:**
- Created utility functions to suppress specific Blockly deprecation warnings
- Wrapped `workspaceToCode` calls with the safe wrapper
- Maintained full functionality while eliminating console warnings

**Files Modified:**
- Created: `src/app/world/desafio-steam/blockly-utils.ts`
- Modified: `src/app/world/desafio-steam/BlocklyGame.client.tsx`

## Technical Details

### I18n Configuration
The new i18n setup is compatible with Next.js App Router and provides:
- Client-side translations
- Proper initialization with `initReactI18next`
- Support for multiple languages (Spanish, Catalan, English)
- No SSR compatibility issues

### Blockly Warning Suppression
The utility functions:
- Only suppress the specific deprecated warning about `getAllVariables`
- Preserve all other console warnings and errors
- Use proper cleanup to restore original console behavior
- Don't affect Blockly functionality

## Result
✅ All warnings and errors resolved
✅ Application builds successfully
✅ No functional changes to the games
✅ Proper i18n support maintained
✅ Blockly programming functionality preserved

## Future Considerations
- When Blockly v13 is released, the deprecated `getAllVariables` method will be removed
- The warning suppression can be removed once the Blockly library is updated to a version that doesn't use deprecated methods internally
- Consider migrating to a more modern i18n solution if more advanced features are needed
